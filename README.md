How do you play Connect Four?
Connect Four is a two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, seven-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens
